TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE



The technical architecture of OLP app follows a client-server model, where the frontend serves as the client and the backend acts as the server. The frontend encompasses not only the user interface and presentation but also incorporates the axios library to connect with backend easily by using RESTful Apis.


The frontend utilizes the bootstrap and material UI library to establish real-time and better UI experience for any user.


On the backend side, we employ Express.js frameworks to handle the server-side logic and communication. 

For data storage and retrieval, our backend relies on MongoDB. MongoDB allows for efficient and scalable storage of user data and necessary information about the place.


Together, the frontend and backend components, along with Express.js, and MongoDB, form a comprehensive technical architecture for our OLP app. This architecture enables real-time communication, efficient data exchange, and seamless integration, ensuring a smooth and immersive blogging experience for all users.
